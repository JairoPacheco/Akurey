The following code was made on pycharm IDE

# Proposed solution

1-Create the necessary python classes to create a tree, in this case they are Btree and Bnode, along with their attributes.

2-The first step to solve the problem was to create the b-tree that was needed later,
for this I created the insert function, 
this funtion creates a node that is goint to be the root in case the root is without data, 
if the root already exists but it is not full add the data to that node
and if the root is full it restructures the nodes to create new children.

3-Print the tree to verify that it is correct, and during this process I take the opportunity to create the columns of the matrix that we want to create,
which correspond to all the values that exist in the tree

4-Find the siblings and the rest of the tree of the node where we are in order to create the rows of matrices.

This fourth part cannot create it,
It had been a long time since I worked with trees and it was the first time I worked with this type of trees and it was quite difficult for me to understand the whole data structure,
then it was very difficult for me to be able to handle it as I would have liked,
but I tried to solve the problem as much as possible.
